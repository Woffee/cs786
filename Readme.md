Codes & data for CS786 - REAL WORLD GRAPH ANALYTICS

## Homework: Graph properties

Using the graph generators available from:

http://www.cse.psu.edu/~kxm85/software/GTgraph/

for "SSCA", "random" and "R-MAT",  generate moderate-sized sythetic graphs of approximately the same number of vertices and edges, and then implement the following algorithms:

1. Breadth-first Search

2. Shortest path between two randomly selected vertices [REPEAT 200 times]

3. Degree distribution of the vertices
